#labels Featured

===Version 0.5.5 - 2012-05-16===
 * Fixed backward/forward compatibility issue in protocol
 * Updated pom.xml maven-license-plugin to validate open source licenses in deploy phase rather than verify phase, to allow "mvn install" to run and install locally for testing or experimental builds

===Version 0.5.4 - 2012-04-06===
 * Updated the project's `pom.xml` with additional metadata required for deploying to Maven Central
 * GPG-signed and deployed version 0.5.4 to Sonatype public repo, and requested sync with Maven Central

===Version 0.5.2 - 2012-03-03===

 * Added `MobilitySession.execute(String, Runnable)` and `execute(String, Callable)`, convenience methods to send objects to a `String` machine name using default port

===Version 0.5.1 - 2012-02-20===
 * First release version
 * Built with maven-shade-plugin, includes all dependencies
 * Jar can be used as a library in an application, or run as a `StandaloneMobilityServer`: java -jar mobility-rpc-0.5.1-all.jar
