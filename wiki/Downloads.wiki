== Download for Maven Projects ==

Mobility-RPC is in Maven Central, and can be added to a Maven project as follows:
{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.googlecode.mobilityrpc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mobility-rpc</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

== Download for non-Maven projects or standalone server ==

The library has some dependencies of it's own (see TechnologiesUsed), which, above, Maven would take care of automatically.

For non-Maven projects, a special build of the library is also provided, built with [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/ maven-shade-plugin], which contains the library and all of the library's own dependencies packaged in a single jar file (ending "-all"). This build can be downloaded directly from [http://code.google.com/p/mobility-rpc/downloads/list here].
